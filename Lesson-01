Cloud Platform manages the underlying infrastructure
Can terminate the services if we dont want to use those services
Pay per usage 

VMs Redundancy:
Availability Set:
      VMs designated in Availability sets are related. They should be distributed in across the fault domains.
      not same machine or rack. ensuring far enough apart. Copies of each other must be seperated far.
      
Availability Zone:
      Roughly be equated to Data centers. Each region consists of 3 or more DCs which are in different locations. 
      Manulally deploy into a specific DC. Eliminates building level outages.
      
VM Scale Set: ( Sclabality )
      Automcatically scales in and out depends on the demand.

Spot Instances:
      Requesting for a low-priced Vms at a discounted rate. If no one else is using such VMs, it will be released. Usually
      it is best suited for low-priority batch jobs that runs for a day or two.
 
 Instance Type and Size:
      Select appropriate VM size from 568 Options provided by Microsoft. 
      
 Encryption:
      1- Encryption is at rest by defdault with platform managed key.
      2- with customer managed key
      3- Double encryption with both customer-managed and platform managed key
 Connect to VMs:
      - RDP usually Windows
      - SSH usually for linux / Unix based
      - Bastion is a Java ( Jump service) based service to connect securely to a VM
  Azure Resource Manager (ARM)
      - It is a deployment model ( it is an engine), where the interfaces uses this ARM to interact with the services.
      - Bicep is a new tool helps to create a ARM Template.
